🍽️ Simple CLI Restaurant System (Java)

Welcome to my very first Java project — a Simple Restaurant Management System that runs in the command line (CLI). This application is designed for customers to interact with a restaurant menu, place orders, and see their bill — all from the terminal.
🚀 Features

    View the full restaurant menu

    Select and order items

    Calculate total cost

    Clear and user-friendly CLI interface

    Written fully in Java using basic concepts like:

        Loops

        Conditionals

        Arrays / Lists

        Methods

        Object-Oriented Programming

📦 How to Run

    Clone or Download the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-restaurant-java.git
cd cli-restaurant-java

    Compile the Java files:

javac RestaurantSystem.java

    Replace RestaurantSystem.java with your main class if it has a different name or multiple files.

    Run the program:

java RestaurantSystem

    Follow the on-screen prompts to:

        View the menu

        Place your order

        Check out your total
